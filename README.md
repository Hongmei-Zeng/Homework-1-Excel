The Homework includes two files, "StarterBook 11-15-2019.xlsx" and "Report on StarterBook.docx".

"StarterBook 11-15-2019.xlsx" has 7 sheets.

Sheet 1 is the original dataset table, plus the below work has been done in it
*	Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the `state` column with a different color, depending on whether the associated campaign was successful, failed, or canceled, or is currently live.

* Create a new column O called `Percent Funded` that uses a formula to uncover how much money a campaign made to reach its initial goal.

*	Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the `Percent Funded` column using a three-color scale. The scale should start at 0 and be a dark shade of red, transitioning to green at 100, and blue at 200.

*	Create a new column P called `Average Donation` that uses a formula to uncover how much each backer for the project paid on average.

*	Create two new columns, one called `Category` at Q and another called `Sub-Category` at R, which use formulas to split the `Category and Sub-Category` column into two parts.

*	The dates stored within the `deadline` and `launched_at` columns use Unix timestamps. 

*	Create a new column named `Date Created Conversion’…

*	 Create a new column named `Date Ended Conversion’…

Sheet 2 presents the work:

*	Create a new sheet with a pivot table that will analyze your initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per category

*	Create a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country based on the table you have created.

Sheet 3 presents the work:

*	Create a new sheet with a pivot table that will analyze your initial sheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, or canceled, or are currently live per sub-category

*	Create a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country and parent-category based on the table you have created.

Sheet 4 presents the work:

*	Create a new sheet with a pivot table with a column of `state`, rows of `Date Created Conversion`, values based on the count of `state`, and filters based on `parent category` and `Years`.

*	Create a pivot chart line graph that visualizes this new table.

Sheet 5 presents the bonus work.

Sheet 6 & 7 are used to produce tables and graphs for the report.

The file "Report on StarterBook.docx" includes five parts: Introduction, Strategies, Three important findings, Some limitations of this dataset, and Some other possible tables and/or graphs.
